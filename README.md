# Text-based-Data-Visaulisation
# Objective
The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets. The term is often used interchangeably with others, including information graphics, information visualization and statistical graphics.
Text visualization is a visual way of presenting informationâ€”word clouds, graphs, maps, timelines, networks and more, can all be used to visualize text data. Doing so provides a brief understanding of the most important keywords, and sums up and communicates trends and frameworks within a specific text.
